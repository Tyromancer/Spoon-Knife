I am currently thinking to redo a previous course project using Go and Vue.js, and make it a online platform for "bargaining" for URP positions, recommendation letters, .etc.
I feel like email alone is not sufficient nor efficient for the communication between professor/faculty and students.
Another reason for doing it in Go is I am learning Go right now, and this looks like a good chance for some hands-on experience.
